/**
 * Transforms the input into a className.
 * The multiplication constant 113 is selected to be a prime,
 * as is the initial value of 11.
 * The intermediate and final results are truncated into 32-bit
 * unsigned integers.
 *
 * --Detailed--
 * Each character of the string is converted to it's unicode value
 * which is added to the integer value (out) from the previous iteration
 * which to start with is 11 here.
 *
 * This being multiplied by 101 has no specific result and could be any number.
 * The result of this is then shifted right, specifically unsigned right shift
 * which is required since we need positive integer values.
 *
 * Since JS's unsigned right shift doesn't support BigInts you end up with a
 * 32bit integer value

 * @param {String} str
 * @returns {String}
